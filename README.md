# Katas project

Personal project with code katas I have made.
Each code kata is in a different directory. Inside each directory, there is one folder for each different language implementation. Each implementation is also in one folder inside each language folder, so it has space for different implementations / solutions.

# Goal

The main goal of this project is to make a recopilation to all code katas I have made in order to view all practices and decisions made in each one and learn from practice. I think this could also help other people (comparing solutions, analising resolved katas, etc).

# Code kata explanation

Inside each code kata folder a `README` file is available describing the kata (using the available `KATA_TEMPLATE`).

Each kata includes a brief explanation, a link of reference and the rules (if any).

# Solution explanation

Each solution folder contains a `README` explaining how to build, run and test the solution (using the available `SOLUTION_TEMPLATE`). The requirements to use sources are also listed with any other relevant info.
